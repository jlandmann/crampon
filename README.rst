**Description**

This is what it should look like when it's done:

Installation
------------

When everything is done, this will hopefully even be installable as a Python package.


Documentation
-------------

Might be hosted at `readthedocs.org`_, it would give a nice opportunity to inform about the project even though it is private content (Need to check if this makes sense/is in conflict). Maybe one could also create a synced lonely repot with just the docs.

.. _readthedocs.org: www.readthedocs.org


Contribution
------------

The number of participants in a private repo is of course limited, but, PLEASE, if you can contribute to the project regarding:

- The Physics/Glaciology/Empiry behind it

- General workflow/design improvements of the model

- Packages used

- Numerical/Computational effort behind it

- Useful APIs to other projects

Fork it and make a pull request or contact me personally or via the below contact deatils.


ToDo
----

There's tons of work. First steps might be:

- Set up a suitable lightweight test data set

- Write some simple mass balance code including a first, little test suite

- Run the test suite

- Extend the code to cover more and more processes
