Albedo from Satellite Observations
==================================

Albedo is one of the most straightforward parameters that can be derived from satellite images.
To compensate for the distinct satellite bands that cover only parts of the visible spectrum we perform a narrow-to-broadband albedo conversion.
Since this conversion is erroneous, we apply two algorithms that perform this conversion:

1. Liu
2. the other one
